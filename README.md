# Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics in Python is a collection of scripts, utilities, and projects for solving computational biology problems. The repository includes implementations of DNA/RNA sequence analysis, structural modeling, and algorithmic solutions to classical bioinformatics challenges (e.g., Rosalind problems). It serves as both a learning resource and a toolkit for applying Python to biological data.

The primary goals of this repository are:
- To **practice and document solutions** to classical bioinformatics problems (e.g., Rosalind challenges).
- To provide **reusable Python scripts** for DNA/RNA sequence manipulation and analysis.
- To serve as a **learning reference** for those interested in applying Python to biological datasets.

## Rosalind Problems

This repository also includes solutions to [Rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info) problems, which are widely used for learning bioinformatics through programming.  

### Stronghold Section:
- Complementing a DNA strand  
- Counting nucleotides  
- Transcribing DNA to RNA  
*(More problems will be added as progress continues)*
