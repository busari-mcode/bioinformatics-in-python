# Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics in Python is a collection of scripts, utilities, and projects for solving computational biology problems. The repository includes implementations of DNA/RNA sequence analysis, structural modeling, and algorithmic solutions to classical bioinformatics challenges (e.g., Rosalind problems). It serves as both a learning resource and a toolkit for applying Python to biological data.
